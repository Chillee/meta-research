## meta-research

A set of tools to better understand how AI research is done

### Todo

- Integrate ICML / NIPS data sources into a robust script.  (Inspired by @dcharrezt's work.)
- Create a more consistent API that can be used across venues.
- Integrate this all into a user-friendly web-frontend.

### Architecture

- Bespoke scraping tools to be Python scripts (for dynamic typing).
- Core API to be written in Rust / OCaml.
- Python frontends to make it usable for researchers.
- Frontend in ClojureScript.
